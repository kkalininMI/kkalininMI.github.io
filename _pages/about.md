I am a political methodologist and comparativist with expertise in statistical analysis, [artificial intelligence](/hooverai), election forensics, survey methodology and statistical software development.  

I have worked at Stanford University's Hoover Institution since 2017 in various positions as a [National Fellow](http://www.hoover.org/profiles/kirill-kalinin), Researcher and Data Analyst.  Before coming to Stanford, I studied and worked at the University of Michigan, where I received my PhD in political science in 2017.

My research in political science has been published in  *Political Studies*, *Journal of Elections*, *Public Opinion and Parties*,  *British Journal of Politics and International Relations*, *Russian Politics* and *Electoral Politics*.  I have authored and co-authored several [statistical packages](https://github.com/kkalininMI) and co-created [Election Forensics Toolkit](https://electionforensics.cps.isr.umich.edu/about) web application, providing useful accuracy diagnostics for detection and measurement of election fraud. I am also one of the co-organizers of the [Survey of Russian Elites](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/3724). My research has been featured in various [media](/media) outlets.
