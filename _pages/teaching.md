Teaching Statement
-----

My teaching and mentorship abilities would enrich and expand the Department of Political Science program both substantively and methodologically. I possess five main assets I can bring to the Department:

* methodological training both at Michigan (political methodology, election forensics, survey methodology) and Stanford (machine learning, causal inference, artificial intelligence - natural language processing and convolutional neural networks);

* the ability to teach a range of comparative politics courses that can be tailored to the post-Soviet region;

* proven experience as a teacher for an advanced graduate level quantitative methods course and undergraduate comparative and world politics at the University of Michigan;

* the ability to teach survey methods for developing countries and teach courses on election forensics methodology;

* an intuitive approach to quantitative methods that complements and deepens a classic methods sequence by emphasizing the role of theory and survey methodology.

My goal as an instructor is to teach my students to approach the topic of election fraud -- or any topic -- like political scientists. I want them to rely on data rather than intuition; to distinguish pattern from idiosyncrasy; to view events as probabilistic rather than deterministic; and to be critical consumers of popular political analysis. In other words, I want my students to understand what we know about politics, what we don't know (even though the pundits might say we do), and how we go about reaching these conclusions. In a lecture context, this means presenting the best research in the field, explaining what makes it credible and highlighting what still remains to be studied. In a seminar, it means training students to read and assess the quality of research for themselves.  In my classes I also encourage students to push themselves by constantly testing the boundaries of what is possible, knowable, and doable. The constant expansion of knowledge and ability is for me the unifying feature of both research and learning, and my goal is for students to experience this kind of expansion and enjoy it.
