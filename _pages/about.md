I am a political methodologist and comparativist with expertise in statistical analysis, artificial intelligence, election forensics, survey methodology and statistical software development.  I have worked at Stanford University's Hoover Institution since 2017 in various positions as a [National Fellow](http://www.hoover.org/profiles/kirill-kalinin), Researcher and Data Analyst.  

In 2020, I launched <i>Hoover AI<sup>2</sup></i> ("Hoover Applied Artificial Intelligence Initiative") with support from a group of senior fellows and the Hoover Library and Archives, and was involved in developing AI projects.

My research in political science has been published in  <i>Political Studies</i>, <i>Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties</i>,  <i>the British Journal of Politics and International Relations</i>, <i>Russian Politics</i>,  <i>Electoral Politics</i>.  I have authored or co-authored several [R packages](https://github.com/kkalininMI) and co-created [Election Forensics Toolkit](https://electionforensics.cps.isr.umich.edu/about), providing useful accuracy diagnostics for detection and measurement of election fraud. I am also one of the organizers of the [Survey of Russian Elites](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/3724).
  
My research has been featured in in the <i>Washington Post's</i> Monkey Cage concerning forensic analyses of elections in different countries, as well as in various Russian media outlets.
